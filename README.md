# Abstract

Apple doesn't provide any way to interact with their App Store programatically and Google doesn't provide a command line interface, which means releasing software can be a pain, releases don't happen as often as it should, and something frequently goes wrong because humans are involved. In this lecture, we find a solution to this very problem and other everyday tedious tasks, such as developer certificate provisioning and code signing by using the popular http://Fastlane.tools framework.
